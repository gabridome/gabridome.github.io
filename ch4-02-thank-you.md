Thank you for reading 21 Lessons. I hope you enjoyed it. If you did,
[please leave a review on Amazon][amazon] (or on [Goodreads][goodreads]) and share it with
your friends. If you didn't, or have any suggestions for improvements, please reach out to
me directly.

I am currently working on a second, more ambitious project: *21 Ways*. You can
[support me on Patreon][patreon] to get an exclusive glimpse and early access to current
drafts, artwork, and other things. Your support allows me to allocate more time to writing
and creating free, open-source education. It's what I love to do. I hope that I will be able
to dedicate all my time to it one day. To all of you who support me already: thank you. From
the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
